# Introduction

Our goal is to create an app for students to leave reviews and ratings on various restrooms across Grand Valley. Our rating system will be a 5-star scale, which will display an average for each bathroom based on user submissions. Reviews/Comments can be left below a bathroom to give some specifics about the experience. Only users who have successfully created an account will be given access to creating a rating or review. Along with this, to make sure our app stays secure and free of meaningless spam, only GVSU affiliated users may create a valid account.

We will separate bathrooms by buildings and have a structured labeling system to designate bathrooms based on floors and orientation of the building. We will also create specific instructions on how to find/enter each bathroom listed. Currently we have our sights set on detailing the bathrooms in Mackinac Hall alone simply due for time's sake, but making the app scalable to support further additions in the future if we were to continue with development and data collection.

## Features
### Essential
* User can create an account
* User can log in to a valid account

# Anticipated Technologies

The use of Typescript, SQL, and React.

# Method/Approach

We are using a Jira board to track our progress using an Agile methodology. The Jira board lists tasks pertaining to different portions of the project. These portions are given the labels Back-End Development, Front-End Development, or Documentation. Another label given would be if the tasks pertain to Development as a whole, GitHub, or Testing.

As described in other documents, these portions of the project are divided among the different members of the group. Hunter will handle documentation and business analysis, Horacio will handle the front-end development and testing for the back-end, and Jack will handle the back-end development.
