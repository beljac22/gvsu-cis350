# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)
(Also define some loosely defined features of your project using bullet points)

We're going to create a website where students can review restrooms in Grand Valley. Our rating system will be a 5-point scale. The reviews will be predicated in things like cleanliness, capacity, etc. People that aren't affiliated with GVSU can't create reviews. People will have to sign in to their gvsu account.

Before someone releases their review, they have the option to be anonymous or known. The website will have sections like the home page, contact page, etc. There will be a search engine to find reviews for specific restrooms. You can also use the search tool to find specific star ratings like 3 for example. We'll also create a map that highlights the restrooms and whey they're located, but this is optional for now.
