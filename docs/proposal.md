# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)
(Also define some loosely defined features of your project using bullet points)

We're going to create a website where students can review restrooms in Grand Valley. Our rating system will be a 5-star scale. The reviews will be predicated on an average of user star ratings. People that are not affiliated with GVSU can't create reviews. People will have to sign in to their gvsu account.

Before someone releases their review, they have the option to be anonymous or known. The website will have sections like the home page, contact page, etc. There will be a search engine to find reviews for specific restrooms. You can also use the search tool to find specific star ratings like 3 for example. We'll also create a map that highlights the restrooms and whey they're located, but this is optional for now.

# Anticipated Technologies

The use of Typescript, SQL, and React.

# Method/Approach

We are using a Jira board to track our progress using an Agile methodology. The Jira board lists tasks pertaining to different portions of the project. These portions are given the labels Back-End Development, Front-End Development, or Documentation. Another label given would be if the tasks pertain to Development as a whole, GitHub, or Testing.

As described in other documents, these portions of the project are divided among the different members of the group. The development is handled by Horacio (front-end) and Jack (back-end), while the documentation and testing is handled by Hunter.
