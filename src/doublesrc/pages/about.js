      Hello people! I would like to introduce what this website is about. This is a review website 
      for bathrooms at Grand Valley State University. The idea behind creating this website is so people
      can figure out which bathrooms to avoid and which bathroom to visit in certain buildings
      before heading to your 11:00 AM class. Some people don't care how dirty or clean a bathroom is,
      but there's also people that do care about it. The people that care is who this website is meant for.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      The review system used here is a 5-point rating system that is based on cleanliness,
      capacity, accessibility, etc. There will be average ratings for each bathroom's cleanliness, 
      capacity, & accessibility. You will also have the ability to post a comment too. 
      Since there's multiple bathrooms in each floor of buildings at GVSU, it could be confusing which
      bathroom someone is refering to. To mitigate confusion, the review page will have images of buildings
      from the outside along with directions of how to find specific bathrooms. By the way, in order to
      leave a comment you have to sign in with your GVSU affiliated email. This is in place, so people
      outside of GVSU aren't reviewing bathrooms they never been to or rarely go to.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      BULLYING, HARASSMENT, & DEROGOTORY LANGUAGE IS PROHIBITED!!!
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      If you need help with anything on the website or having issues, contact csgzenv@gmail.com
      <br></br>
      I will try my best to answer back as soon as possible.
