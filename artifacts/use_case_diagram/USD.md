# Use Case of our bathroom website that includes the role of the developers, API system, & Users

The users need to sign in if they want to rate and comment. When they sign in the API will recognize and operate accordingly to authenticate user. The developer has to utilize the SQLite Cloud to create a database that the API will take in for the authentication purposes. The developer also has to create the graphical user interface, so it can be visible to the developer and user. Once it's visible, the user can submit their ratings and comments.
